   "LCD_Stopwatch" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc3s500e, package fg320, speed -4

Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range: -40.000 to 100.000 Celsius)
Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to 1.320 Volts)

INFO:Par:282 - No user timing constraints were detected or you have set the option to ignore timing constraints ("par
   -x"). Place and Route will run in "Performance Evaluation Mode" to automatically improve the performance of all
   internal clocks in this design. The PAR timing summary will list the performance achieved for each clock. Note: For
   the fastest runtime, set the effort level to "std".  For best performance, set the effort level to "high". For a
   balance between the fastest runtime and best performance, set the effort level to "med".

Device speed data version:  "PRODUCTION 1.27 2008-01-09".

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

Timing Score: 0

INFO:Timing:2761 - N/A entries in the Constraints list may indicate that the constraint does not cover any paths or that it has no
   requested value.
Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
